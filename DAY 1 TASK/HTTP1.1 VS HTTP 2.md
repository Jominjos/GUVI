HTTP1.1

HTTP1.1 was first released in 1999 and has been the primary protocol used on the web for over two decades. It is a text-based protocol, which means that the data being transferred is in plain text format. HTTP1.1 has several limitations that have become increasingly problematic over time.

Firstly, HTTP1.1 only allows one request and response at a time, which means that the client has to wait for the server to respond before making another request. This can lead to slow load times, especially for large websites.

Secondly, HTTP1.1 headers are not compressed, which means that they can be quite large. This can increase the overall size of the data being transferred and slow down load times.

Finally, HTTP1.1 does not support server push, which means that the server can only send data to the client in response to a request. This can result in a suboptimal user experience, as the client has to wait for the server to respond before receiving all the necessary data.

HTTP2

HTTP2 was released in 2015 and was designed to overcome the limitations of HTTP1.1. One of the key features of HTTP2 is multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and responses to be sent and received over a single connection at the same time. This can significantly improve load times for large websites, as the client can receive multiple resources simultaneously.

HTTP2 also uses header compression, which reduces the size of the headers sent between the client and the server. This can reduce the overall size of the data being transferred and further improve load times.

Another key feature of HTTP2 is server push, which allows the server to proactively send data to the client before the client requests it. This can result in faster load times and a better user experience.

Finally, HTTP2 requires the use of TLS encryption, which provides an additional layer of security compared to HTTP1.1. This can help to protect sensitive data, such as login credentials and credit card information.

Conclusion

In summary, HTTP2 is designed to be faster, more efficient, and more secure than HTTP1.1. It supports multiplexing, header compression, server push, and requires the use of TLS encryption. These features help to overcome the limitations of HTTP1.1 and provide a better user experience for web users. As more websites transition to HTTP2, we can expect to see faster load times, improved security, and a more efficient web.
